# An Experiment

With Server Components coming in hot, the T3 Stack is about to change. A lot. This repo is for me to experiment around it.

## Blockers

- [ ] Server Actions need to ship
- [ ] Mutation best practices needed to be decided on (tRPC? Zact? tbd)
- [ ] Server Actions need to run on edge functions (they crash rn)

## Bloodiest edges

- Next canary version (13.2.5)
- Drizzle-kit canary version (drizzle-kit@db-push)
